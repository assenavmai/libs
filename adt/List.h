 /******************************
 Interface for a List ADT

 Author: Vanessa White
 May, 2015

 This ADT provides basic operations for a list as the datatype.
 Throughout time, I may update it to include new operations, but for now
 it does the bare minimum

 The purpose of the ADT is to grant some flexibility when it comes to using a linked list and to be able to use it
 with any data type you like.

 This ADT does need to Boolean typedef enumeration to function 
 properly. If you do not want to include it you can simply declare
 in this file:

 typedef enum{false, true}Boolean;

 You must provide two function pointers inorder to use this library:

 1) Compare function pointer, it can be called whatever you please but the parameters
 must look something like this:

 int compare(void* data1, void* data2);

 return a positive number when data1 is larger than data2
 reutrn a negative number when data1 is less than data 2
 return zero when data1 equals data2

 The values of data1 and data2 do not have to be integers, they can be any data type you like

 2) Destory function pointer

 Essentially, it can have what you like in the function, but the signature must be as follows:

 void destroy(void * data)


The compare and destroy is used quite frequently throughout my code, you may not see it since they are helper functions.

Currently, the compare is not used as much in this ADT. It would be used for in-order insertion and deletion which may be added
at a later date.

There is one more feature that you may or may not use and that is the printing function. It is good to use for testing which is what I
used it for but you may find it useful. Create a function that is similar to this:

void printData(void* data);

As always, feel free to name the function whatever you like.

This code was tested with Valgrind on Ubuntu 12.04. If there are any issues feel free to contact me
